This repository contained some homework, solutions and links.
One of my Professors got in contact with me asking me to delete this project since students used it to get around doing the homework themselvs.

Dear students,
if you like studying what you study please do the homework yourself. Furthermore I would like to encourage you to join and help some FOSS projects to get experience and sharpen your skills. And doing this even help the community by giving back :-)
